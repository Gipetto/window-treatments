  # Window Treatments

  Window treatments is a faux-window library for Svelte.

  It is unopinionated about the formatting of the tab content. If you want syntax highlighting then pre-format the content before passing it in to the Window pane.

  ## Features

  - Multiple tabs
  - Drag & drop reordering of tabs
  - Window controls
    - Resizable windows
    - Window shade
    - Close window
  - Accessibility (per web standards)
    - Tab-key in to tabs list
    - Arrow keys to cycle through tabs
    - Return key to select tab

  ## TODO

  - Finalize API for passing data
    - Composability vs. passing complex object
  - Abstract out drag & drop functionality for re-use
  - Multiple Themes: Theming strategy is still up in the air
    - Create light and dark variants
    - Create "lickable" old-school OS X theme
  - Mobile re-ordering of tabs: It kinda works, but it clunky
  - Constrain tab previews to header when dragging
  - Scroll tab list on small screens (or fall back to vertical tab list?)
  - Line numbers? A syntax highlighting library will do this, so maybe its not a feature we need?
  - Convert Platinum theme that exists as a React experiment
    - Standardize outer window layout or allow it to exist as a separate set of components? 
    - The OS 9 HIG has a lot going on.
  - Tests
